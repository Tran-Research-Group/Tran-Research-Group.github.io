We work on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods to create teams of autonomous agents that can work together to solve challenging tasks, such as search-and-rescue, traffic control, autonomous driving, and warehouse robotics.

## Improving decentralized training with successor features

This work leverages successor features (SFs) to **disentangle** an individual agentâ€™s impact on the global value function from that of all other agents, thus enabling better training of decentralized agents. The video shows an example of gameplay from the Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) where the red agents learned to surround the blue agents and win the game, despite being at a numbers disadvantage (27 vs. 30 agents). See our AAMAS paper presenting our approach, named **DISentangling Successor features for Coordination (DISSC)**, for more details.

<!-- ## Learning multi-agent roles

This work builds from [DISSC](#improving-decentralized-training-with-successor-features) by leveraging SFs to learn **roles** that individual agents can use within a team, inspired by the use of different positions in team sports like football and basketball. Our preliminary results show **TODO**. -->

<!-- ## Leveraging communication through coordination graphs

This work aims to **TODO**. -->
