We work on artificial intelligence and controls methods to enable autonomous flight vehicles, for example for space applications and urban air mobility.

## Fast adaptation for autonomous landers

This work explores the use of **model-based meta-RL** for the spacecraft powered descent guidance and control (PDG) problem. The system aims to be robust to potential uncertainties or new dynamics, for example due to engine failures or unexpected atmospheric conditions.

## Traversability for robot navigation in the field

This work presents a new method for robot navigation in unstructured, outdoor environments based on self-supervised **traversability estimations**. See our RA-L paper presenting our approach, named **Waypoint Free Autonomous Systems for Traversability (WayFAST)**, for more details.
