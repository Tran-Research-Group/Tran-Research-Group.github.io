We work on artificial intelligence and controls methods to enable autonomous flight vehicles, for example for space applications and urban air mobility.

## Fast adaptation for autonomous landers

This work explores the use of **model-based meta-RL** for designing a navigation and control system for autonomous landing of a space vehicles. The system aims to be robust to potential uncertainties or new dynamics, for example due to engine failures or unexpected atmospheric conditions.
