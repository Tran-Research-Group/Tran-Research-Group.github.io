We work on learning methods to create autonomous agents that can effectively partner with different humans in collaborative tasks, like search-and-rescue, space exploration, and autonomous construction.

## Learning adaptable human models with successor features

This work explores the use of successor features to learn decision-making models of humans that can be **quickly adapted to account for biases of new human teammates**.
