I"Y<p>Welcome! Our goal is to advance research on autonomous systems with a focus on autonomous agents that interact with each other and humans. We primarily work at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, multi-agent systems, and controls, though we often draw inspiration from other fields, like neuroscience, as well.</p>
