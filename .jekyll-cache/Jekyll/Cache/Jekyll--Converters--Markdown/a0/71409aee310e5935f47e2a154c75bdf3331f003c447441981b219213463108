<p>This work explores applications of MARL to traffic light control. We are specifically exploring the integration of hierarchical RL with MARL for this problem. We use SUMO as the traffic simulator.</p>

<p>This work builds upon our earlier work using <a href="#predicting-delays-in-railway-networks">STGNNs for railway networks</a> by exploring potential benefits of STGNNs with <strong>various graph convolution operations</strong> towards delay prediction in air transportation networks.</p>

<p>This work leverages <strong>spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs)</strong> to predict delays in railway networks. We find that STGNNs improve predication accuracy relative to linear and vanilla multi-layer perceptron models. See our ITSC paper presenting our results for more details.</p>
