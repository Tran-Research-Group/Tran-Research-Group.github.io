I"J<p>Our paper “Evaluating Adaptation Performance of Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning” was accepted at the 2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Autonomation (ICRA)! We show that hierarchical RL better adapts to new enemy dynamics in a game of capture-the-flag than typical “flat” RL architectures.</p>
