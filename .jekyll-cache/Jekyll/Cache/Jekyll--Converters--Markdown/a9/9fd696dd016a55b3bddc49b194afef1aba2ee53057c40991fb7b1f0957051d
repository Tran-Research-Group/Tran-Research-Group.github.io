<p>This work explores the use of <strong>model-based meta-RL</strong> for designing a navigation and control system for autonomous landing of a space vehicles. The system aims to be robust to potential uncertainties or new dynamics, for example due to engine failures or unexpected atmospheric conditions.</p>
