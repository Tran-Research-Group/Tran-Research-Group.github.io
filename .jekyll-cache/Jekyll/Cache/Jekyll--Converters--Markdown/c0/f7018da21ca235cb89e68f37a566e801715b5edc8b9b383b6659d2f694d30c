I"∫<p>Our paper ‚ÄúA Complex Network Framework for Validated Assessments of Systems of Systems Robustness‚Äù was accepted for publication in the IEEE Systems Journal! We present a framework for rapid quantitative comparisons of robustness in system of systems (SoS) architectures that leverages complex network methods for assessing robustness and design of experiments (DoE) techniques for validating their use in the scenario of interest.</p>
