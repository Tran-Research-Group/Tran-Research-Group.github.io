I"4<p>Our paper “Data-driven Analysis of Resilience in Airline Networks” was accepted for publication in Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review! We present new techniques combining data-driven methods with network theory to analyze resilience in airline networks. We find that simultaneously considering data-driven and network approaches provides a more comprehensive understanding of resilience than the consideration of any one in isolation.</p>
