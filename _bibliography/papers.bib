	abstract = {We present a self-supervised approach for learning to predict traversable paths for wheeled mobile robots that require good traction to navigate. Our algorithm, termed WayFAST (Waypoint Free Autonomous Systems for Traversability), uses RGB and depth data, along with navigation experience, to autonomously generate traversable paths in outdoor unstructured environments. Our key inspiration is that traction can be estimated for rolling robots using kinodynamic models. Using traction estimates provided by an online receding horizon estimator, we are able to train a traversability prediction neural network in a self-supervised manner, without requiring heuristics utilized by previous methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of WayFAST through extensive field testing in varying environments, ranging from sandy dry beaches to forest canopies and snow covered grass fields. Our results clearly demonstrate that WayFAST can learn to avoid geometric obstacles as well as untraversable terrain, such as snow, which would be difficult to avoid with sensors that provide only geometric data, such as LiDAR. Furthermore, we show that our training pipeline based on online traction estimates is more data-efficient than other heuristic-based methods.},

Ad hoc teaming (AHT) is a more specific problem formulation in which an agent must successfully coordinate with other previously unseen teammates. We model our problem within the framework of a multi-agent Markov decision process (MMDP) and use successor features and generalized policy improvement for efficient and effective knowledge transfer between different teams. Theoretical optimality bounds are derived and an algorithm is proposed for zero-shot coordination with an ad hoc team. We empirically demonstrate that our method successfully transfers to new teams in a collaborative object-collecting game environment.},
