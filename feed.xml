AI/ML systems for Army missions require the ability to adapt to changing dynamics and adversaries. This project aims to address this critical challenge through three research thrusts. Thrust one will develop machine vision systems that provide improved perception and prediction capabilities in situations with missing data, as would be the case when environmental conditions are unknown or insufficiently sensed. Thrust two will develop reinforcement learning algorithms and architectures for planning with multi-domain teams (including human supervisors) that are able to adapt to evolving dynamics and adversaries. Thrust three will evaluate these methods in a demonstration platform that seamlessly transitions from simulation-based prototyping to hardware-in-the-loop testing to real-world demonstrations on ground and aerial unmanned vehicles.</p>

We demonstrate the value of social media for critical infrastructure (CI) resilience by using social media to model CI behaviors at higher spatiotemporal resolutions than previously shown. We find evidence of statistically significant correlations between Twitter and power system data, and develop models for forecasting future behaviors in the NYISO power system using these data.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">We are awarded funding from DARPA!</title><link href="https://tran.aerospace.illinois.edu/news/DARPA/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="We are awarded funding from DARPA!" /><published>2018-08-29T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-05-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://tran.aerospace.illinois.edu/news/DARPA</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tran.aerospace.illinois.edu/news/DARPA/"><![CDATA[<p>Our project titled “A Demonstration Platform for Dynamic Mission Planning with Multi-domain Autonomous Systems” is selected for funding by the DARPA STO program! Our project aims to develop a demonstration platform for teams of quad-rotors and ground-based robots competing in games of capture-the-flag, along with hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) methods for teams of agents to win these games.</p>

<p>This project is a collaboration with Dr. Girish Chowdhary, Dr. RS Sreenivas, Dr. Jaggi Yedetore, and Dr. Heather Filippini from UIUC.</p>

<p>Update: We received funding to expand this project to develop multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for adversarial environments and create an integrated pipeline for using these and other machine learning algorithms with DARPA’s STITCHES framework.</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Urbana, IL&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fas fa-map-marker-alt&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://aerospace.illinois.edu/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Email&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fas fa-fw fa-envelope-square&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;mailto:huytran1@illinois.edu&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Google Scholar&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fa fa-graduation-cap&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TgaPukcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Twitter&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://twitter.com/huytrtran&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/tran-research-group&quot;}]}</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="artificial intelligence" /><category term="multi-agent systems" /><category term="reinforcement learning" /><category term="robotics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our project titled “A Demonstration Platform for Dynamic Mission Planning with Multi-domain Autonomous Systems” is selected for funding by the DARPA STO program!
