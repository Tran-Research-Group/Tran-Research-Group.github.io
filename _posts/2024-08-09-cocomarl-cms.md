Jacob gave a poster presentation of our paper "Coordination Machines for Minimizing Communication in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" at the [Coordination and Cooperation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (CoCoMARL) Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/cocomarl-2024/home?authuser=0) at the [Reinforcement Learning Conference (RLC) 2024](https://rl-conference.cc/index.html)! We present a hierarchical method for minimizing communications subject to mission success requirements.
