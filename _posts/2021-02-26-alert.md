We are excited to be part of the UIUC team (as a project PI) awarded funding from ONR for the Accelerated Learning and Engineering Research Training (ALERT) Program in Cyber and Electronic Warfare for Undergraduate Midshipmen and Cadets. This award gives us the opportunity to work with talented undergraduate ROTC students on research investigating unsupervised anomaly detection methods for graph-structured data, like that found cyber security. The project title is "Detecting Anomalous Behaviors for Assured C2."
